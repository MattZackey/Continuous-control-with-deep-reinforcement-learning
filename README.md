# Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning
The following is an example of applying the [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) algorithm to the [Pendulum swingup](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/pendulum/) environment from Open AI gymnasium. The goal is to swing the Pendulum into an upright position.

To come: Applying DDPG to several MuJoCo and Box2D environments. 

# Training results

The following figure shows the score the agent achieves per espisode of training.
